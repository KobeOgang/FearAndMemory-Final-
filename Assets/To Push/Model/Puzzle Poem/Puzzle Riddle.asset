  itemText: "They come every Wednesday. It was different each time. They were creative,
    you see. But they definitely  had their favorite routine. Certain days they would
    force me to drink water, sometimes it was brandy, a zap if I didn\u2019t finish
    drinking. And when I was filled up like a balloon, they\u2019d decide I\u2019d
    make a great pinata. And they\u2019d use various facilities available in the
    room, pound my belly, force me to puke. But that wasn\u2019t enough, they had
    me puke in a pitcher. Force my mouth open, and force the contents in again.\r\n\r\nWhen
    all the anger left me and all that remained was horror, guilt, dread, they\u2019d
    ask me. Questions about who I work with. Questions about whether I had ties to
    the communists. I didn't, but we organized riots. That never made a difference
    to them. Another round of the Water cure, as they call it. I\u2019d win some
    days when I\u2019d see a hint of frustration from their face. That was a victory.
    But then their pursed lips creep into a smirk. Then they\u2019d ask their final
    question\u2026 if I just wanna help them have a good time instead.\r\n\r\nIt
    was better than having blood on my hands. I would never betray the cause I believe
    in. After that, my lower regions would feel numb. No pain, just\u2026 emptiness.
    I thank the water cure for being a pseudo-anesthesia.\r\n"
