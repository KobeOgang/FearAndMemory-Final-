  description: A newspaper about the Labor Day Rally...
  itemText: "METROCOM KILLS 3, LABOR DAY RALLY\nMay 1, 1971\n\nWorkers and youths
    marched on May 1 from the Espa\xF1a rotunda down the length of Espa\xF1a, across
    the Quezon Bridge and gathered on P. Burgos in front of the House of Congress.\n\nAccording
    to journalist and screenwriter Ricky Lee, who was present at the event, some
    of the demonstrators began throwing pillboxes, small handheld explosive devices,
    at the troops in front of the congressional building.\n\nIt was at this point
    that the protest became a massacre. There were snipers on roofs in Intramuros,
    prepared for those who would flee. The rooftop snipers began to spray the crowd
    with machine gunfire, killing three.\n"
