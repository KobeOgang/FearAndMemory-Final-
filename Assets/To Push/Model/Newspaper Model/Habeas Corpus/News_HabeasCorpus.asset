  description: A Newspaper about the suspension of the writ of Habeas Corpus. Basically
    allowing warantless arrest.
  itemText: 'HABEAS CORPUS SUSPENDED, RANDOM ARRESTS POSSIBLE

    August 23, 1971


    The
    aftermath of the Plaza Miranda Bombings are grim, and it''s not just the deaths.
    It''s the possibility of the democracy dying.


    The president has linked
    the attack to possible insurgencies which he says necessitated the supression
    of habeas corpus - the writ that mandates warants in arrest.


    Now that the
    writ is suspended, suspects can now be arrested on mere suspicion of crime. This
    allows any dissenters to be incarcerated on grounds of insurgent suspicion.'
