  itemText: "MARTIAL LAW DECLARED, 7 TV STATIONS SHUT DOWN\nSeptember 21, 1972\n\nEver
    since the president declared Martial Law in September 21, he has implemented
    additional measures, including Letter of Instruction 1 which ordered the Military
    to shut down 7 TV stations, specifically targetting the popular ABSCBN network.
    \n\nApart from the network, the administration has shut down 16 daily papers,
    292 radio stations, 66 community papers, and utility companies like Meralco,
    PLDT, and even Philippine Airlines.\n\nThe media crackdown was necessary according
    to Marcos. He claims the media was being used to sow discord and incite rebellion.
    Various political organizations are alarmed and see this move as a way to consolidate
    power."
