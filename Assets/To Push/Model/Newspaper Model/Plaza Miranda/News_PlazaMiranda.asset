    August 21, 1971


    Things
    were lively in the Liberal Party Rally as the event welcomed the senators including
    Geraldo Roxas, Eva Estrada-Kalaw, and Jovito Salonga. As the senators took the
    stage, three grenades were thrown, killing 9 people and injuring 95 people, including
    the senator Salonga who lost an eye and one hearing ear.


    This event was
    seen as a massive blow to the President''s political rivals. The suspect remains
    at large.
