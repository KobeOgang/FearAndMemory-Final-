  itemText: 'JEEPNEY RALLY, 3 STUDENT DEATHS

    February 3, 1971


    The blockade
    in UP Diliman, set up on February 1 still continues to its third day. Students,
    setting up other blockades in Quezon and Metro Manila, disrupted traffic. Police
    intervened and chaos ensued. Shots were fired by policemen as the students threw
    "Pillboxes" (makeshift bombs).


    This exchange resulted in three confirmed
    deaths.'
