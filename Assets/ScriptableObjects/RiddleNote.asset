  description: A strange note with poems on it.
  itemText: "The lions walk first, painting the town red\r\nA rhythmic pace, a quiet
    grace left unsaid\r\nThey pave their roads well, of eaten mice and faun\r\nDutiful
    tithers in their prideful dawn\r\n\r\nThe vultures of weak limbs and stiff beaks\r\nCan
    only ever munch on rot-softened meat\r\nThey wait for the proud parade to pass\r\nFor
    a slight misstep, and they\u2019d litter the grass\r\n\r\nThe rabbits are rather
    unsightly, always skittering\r\nA step, a twitch, an eager itch-\r\nTo always
    look behind or else they\u2019ll find-\r\nThe jaws of a beast, the pavements
    now well-dined"
